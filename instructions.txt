I-- build a webpage for a valet parking business.
   
    User Story.

    1. the platform must have a landing page allowing users to navigate throughout the application.
    2. each request made must be efficient in terms of performance.
    3. security should be optimize to stop people from stealing information.
    4. the current app skeleton should be simple for a better user experience.
    5. all actions should be done as per need.
    6. a persistant layer should design and build at a later time.
